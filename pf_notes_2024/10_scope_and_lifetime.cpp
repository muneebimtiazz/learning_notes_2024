/*
Scope refers to the region of your code where a variable or identifier is visible or accessible. In other words, it defines where you can use a variable within your program. There are typically four scopes in C++:

1-Global Scope: Variables defined at the top level of your program, outside of any function or block, have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the program.
2-Function Scope: Variables defined inside a function have function scope. They are visible and accessible only within that function. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.
3-Block Scope: Variables defined inside a block of code. They are visible and accessible only within that block. Block scope can be nested, meaning you can have blocks within blocks.
4-Class Scope: Variables and members (like functions) defined within a class have class scope. They are accessed using an instance of the class and are typically used to represent the state and behavior of objects created from that class.
