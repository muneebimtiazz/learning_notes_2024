Modules in JavaScript can contain various types of code, including:
Variables and Constants: Modules can define variables and constants that are local to the module and not accessible from other modules unless explicitly exported.
Functions: Modules can contain functions that perform specific tasks. These functions can be exported to make them accessible to other modules.
Classes: JavaScript modules can define classes using the class keyword. These classes can have methods and properties that encapsulate related functionality.
Imports and Exports: Modules can import functionality from other modules using the import statement and export their own functionality using the export keyword.
Configuration Data: Modules can also contain configuration data such as object literals, arrays, or other data structures.
Conditional Logic: Modules can include conditional statements (if, else, switch, etc.) to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.
Error Handling: Modules can handle errors using try...catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during execution
